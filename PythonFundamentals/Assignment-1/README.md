# Python Fundamentals - Assignment 1

This assignment covers fundamental Python programming concepts including input/output operations, basic arithmetic, type conversions, and mathematical calculations.

## 📋 Overview

This assignment contains 10 questions that demonstrate core Python programming skills:

1. **User Input and String Concatenation** - Get user's name and age, then display a greeting
2. **Basic Arithmetic Operations** - Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
3. **Average Calculation** - Calculate the average of three numbers (integers and floats)
4. **Type Conversion** - Convert between string, integer, and float types
5. **Operator Precedence** - Demonstrate BODMAS rule with arithmetic expressions
6. **Variable Swapping** - Swap values of two variables using a temporary variable
7. **Temperature Conversion** - Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
8. **Circle Area Calculation** - Calculate the area of a circle given its radius
9. **Simple Interest Calculation** - Calculate simple interest using principal, rate, and time
10. **Decimal Number Manipulation** - Separate integer and decimal parts of a number

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system
2. Navigate to this directory:
   ```bash
   cd PythonFundamentals/Assignment-1
   ```
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python Assignment-1.py
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python3 Assignment-1.py
   ```

## 📝 Questions Breakdown

### Question 1: User Input and Display
- Prompts for name and age
- Displays a personalized greeting message

### Question 2: Arithmetic Operations
- Takes two numbers as input
- Performs and displays:
  - Sum
  - Difference
  - Product
  - Quotient

### Question 3: Average Calculation
- Takes two integers and one float as input
- Calculates and displays the average

### Question 4: Type Conversion
- Takes a number as string input
- Converts it to integer and float
- Displays each type and its value

### Question 5: Operator Precedence
- Demonstrates BODMAS rule with expression: `10+3*2**2`
- Result: 22 (exponentiation → multiplication → addition)

### Question 6: Variable Swapping
- Takes two numbers as input
- Swaps their values using a temporary variable
- Displays the swapped values

### Question 7: Temperature Conversion
- Converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit
- Formula: `F = (C × 9/5) + 32`

### Question 8: Circle Area
- Calculates the area of a circle
- Formula: `Area = π × r²` (using π = 3.14)

### Question 9: Simple Interest
- Calculates simple interest
- Formula: `SI = (P × R × T) / 100`

### Question 10: Decimal Separation
- Separates integer and decimal parts of a number
- Displays both parts separately
